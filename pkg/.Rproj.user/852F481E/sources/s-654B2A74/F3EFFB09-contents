TCGA breast cancer data}
\description{
The TCGA breast cancer gene expression dataset used in our case study. The dataset (Agilent G450 microarray) is obtained from the TCGA database. It includes gene expression measurements for 207 luminal A cancers and 86 basal-like cancers.
The data only includes expression measurement of genes that overlap with the breast cancer pathway (hsa05224) collected from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database.
